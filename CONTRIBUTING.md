## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm 9.x or higher
- Git
- A GitHub account

### Setup Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-template-project.git
   cd react-template-project
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   npm run setup:dev
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Process

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/description` - Feature development
- `bugfix/description` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/description` - Critical production fixes

### Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following our coding standards
3. Write or update tests as necessary
4. Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   npm run test:all
   ```

5. Commit your changes using conventional commits:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   ```

6. Push to your fork and create a pull request

### Commit Message Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use strict type checking
- Document complex types with JSDoc

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the hooks rules
- Use proper prop validation
- Implement error boundaries where appropriate

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Code Quality

- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Comment complex logic

### File Structure

```
src/
  components/     # Reusable UI components
    ui/          # Base UI components (from shadcn/ui)
  hooks/         # Custom React hooks
  lib/           # Utility libraries
  pages/         # Page components
  types/         # TypeScript type definitions
  utils/         # Utility functions
  test/          # Test files and utilities
```

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

## Pull Request Process
